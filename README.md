# Prediction-of-Volume-of-Sales-of-New-Products
The broad objective of this task was to better understand how specific product types perform against each other. The outcomes of this task will help the sales team better understand how types of products might impact sales across the enterprise
To do this an analysis of historical sales data was done in order to make sales volume predictions for a list of new product types. The focus would be on predicting sales of four different product types: PC, Laptops, Netbooks and Smartphones and then assessing the impact services reviews and customer reviews have on sales of different product types 
Deliverables: The key deliverables for this task were to 1. Identify the Algorithms tested 2. Select an Algorithm and state the reason why it was selected 3. Do charts that show the impact of customer and service reviews on sales volume 4. Export the predicted findings to an excel sheet 5. Predict the sales of 4 specific products - PC, Laptops, Netbooks and Smartphones
Methodology: Regression was used to build machine learning models for this analyses using a choice three popular algorithms. Predictions were also done using all three algorithms and the best for the provided dataset identified. Below a detailed set of steps taken and the codes used are presented.
